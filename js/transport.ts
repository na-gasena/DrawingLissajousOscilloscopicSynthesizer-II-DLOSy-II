/**
 * DLOSy20 - Shared transport / live playback state
 *
 * A passive, dependency-free state holder. The step sequencer writes its play
 * position here; the VCO loop writes its live phase here. Other modules READ
 * from it instead of importing each other, which breaks the
 * step-sequencer ⇄ vco-loop and vco-loop ⇄ vco-ease import cycles.
 *
 * Nothing in this file imports anything — that is the whole point: it sits at
 * the bottom of the dependency graph so every module can depend on it acyclically.
